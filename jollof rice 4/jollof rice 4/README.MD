Homework Assignment #4: Basic Styling


Part 1: Write the Code
 
Let's go back to your recipe (from assignments #1, #2, and #3), and add some styling to it. You can choose to use inline styles, or a <style> block within your document, or an external stylesheet. It's up to you. If you use an external stylesheet make sure to include it in the files you upload.

1. Change the background color of the entire page (choose any color you wish)
2. Change the font size of the paragraphs and lists so they are different sizes.
3. Add padding below each heading (h1, h2 etc) you've used, to space them out from the content they're above.
4. Make the page title (the h1) bold, and make it underlined.
5. Find a website that lists out all the various css properties you can use, and note that URL as a comment in your code.
6. Using that website as a resource, add a styling property that we haven't covered yet.
