        <li>Parboil(precook) the Rice and set aside..<br>
<b>Tip:</b> Parboiling the rice, helps to start the cooking process
 and gets rid of the excess starch in the rice, that usually 
makes the rice grains to clump together (a.k.a Soggy rice).</li><br>

<li>Cook and fry/grill your meat ( beef/chicken/turkey )and set aside the broth or stock</li><br>

<li>  prepare a little stew or sauce. Do this by blending 
the fresh tomatoes and peppers together; then dry out excess liquid by boiling in a pot for
 few minutes. if you already have tomato stew, you can skip this step.</li><br>

<li> Place a pot on heat, add some oil, add chopped onions, fry a 
    bit and then add the blended tomatoes & pepper mix, 
    fry for about 10 minutes and then add the tomato puree.
Cook until the tomato loses its sour taste and the oil begin to rise to the top.<br>
<b>Tip:</b> The use of the concentrated tomato paste is IMPORTANT 
if you want to get that deep reddish-orange color and taste of the party jollof rice.</li><br>


<li> Now Scoop out about a quarter of the stew and set it aside for later use.</li><br>

<li> Add the meat or chicken stock to the pot and leave 
    to boil on high heat for 5-10 minutes. Then add the thyme, curry,
     stock cubes, salt to taste and any other seasoning you like, and boil for 5 minutes.<br>
<b>Tip:</b> This is another important step in cooking Jollof Rice. If the stock isn&apos;t hot
 enough before adding the precooked(parboiled) Rice, the rice will soak up the cold water, 
become soggy and even get burnt before it is done cooking..Eeeww, we don&apos;t want that right?</li><br>

<li> Next, add the parboiled rice and mix thoroughly; the liquid in the pot should
 be at the same level as the rice in the pot. you can add more water if the meat or chicken stock isn&apos;t enough.
Cover the pot and leave the rice to cook on low to medium heat. High heat will burn the rice before it is well cooked.
 If you&apos;re using bay leaves, just drop it on the rice before covering the pot.</li><br>


 <li>When the liquid in the rice is almost dried, add the ground crayfish
  (this is optional) and the remaining stew to the top (don&apos;t touch the rice) 
  cover the pot  and simmer until there is no more liquid in the Rice. 
  Now mix thoroughly and your Jollof Rice is Ready.<br>
<b>Tip:</b> just 5 minutes before the rice is completly done, 
you can add a spoonful of butter/margarine for extra flavor and also 
garnish with tomato and onion slices before mixing thoroughly.
