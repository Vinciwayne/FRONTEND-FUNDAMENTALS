Homework Assignment #1: Lists


Part 1: Write the HTML
 
What's your favorite food? Do you know how to make it yourself? If not, look up the recipe online. Next, create an HTML document, and within the body of the page, create two lists:

1. The first list should be an unordered list of all the ingredients needed to make the dish.

2. The second list should be an ordered list, detailing the steps you need to take to prepare that dish.

Then, add comments to your HTML, to explain the purpose of each section of code that you create.


Part 2: Save the HTML

Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework1.html" etc.

If you are using JS Bin to compose your code, you should be able to find an "export" or "download" option from the menu. You may need to be logged-in to JSbin for that to work. If that doesn't work for you, then simply select and copy your code from JS Bin, then paste it into a text editor, and save the document as an HTML file (with the .html extension). If you don't have a text editor installed on your machine, we recommend you download and use Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, or Notepad++.


Part 3: Put your file in a zip folder [REQUIRED]

Create an empty folder on your desktop. Put your html file in that folder. Then, create a zip file out of that folder, and upload the zip file below. If you don't know how to create a zip file, please read these instructions. If you do not upload a zip file, your homework will be rejected. There are no exceptions to this rule.


Part 4: Wait for approval

Please allow 1 business day for us to manually review the files you have uploaded. All of our student's homework assignments are graded by a real person.


Are you having trouble uploading your file? Is it taking a long time to upload?

First, make sure you have followed step 3 closely and are uploading a zip file. Then, make sure you're uploading from a computer (not a mobile device) and not using a browser with any ad blockers or other extensions that may be interfering with the upload process. If you're still having issues, try using the Chrome browser. If that still doesn't work then our uploader (filestack.com) is having trouble interfacing with the filesystem on your operating system. If that's the case, then your best option is to upload your file to Google Drive or Dropbox first, and then use our file-submission dialog to pull the file down from there (instead of uploading from your desktop).
