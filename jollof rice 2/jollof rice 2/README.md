Homework Assignment #2: Images


Part 1: Write the HTML
 
It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.

1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
3. Somewhere on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the final product should look like.
4. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. You can find emojis online pretty easily. If you don't how to use emojis in HTML, read this article. Then use this reference.

Part 2: Save the HTML

Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework.html" etc.

If you are using JS Bin to compose your code, you should be able to find an "export" or "download" option from the menu. You may need to be logged-in to JSbin for that to work. If that doesn't work for you, then simply select and copy your code from JS Bin, then paste it into a text editor, and save the document as an HTML file (with the .html extension). If you don't have a text editor installed on your machine, we recommend you download and use Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, or Notepad++.


Part 3: Zip and Upload Everything

Create an empty folder on your desktop. In that folder, put the following items:

1. Your HTML file
2. The local images that are referenced in your HTML (if any)

Then, create a zip file out of that folder, and upload the zip file below. If you don't know how to create a zip file, please read these instructions. Please allow 1 business day for us to manually review the files you upload.
